* Version 0.6.1

	Main changes from 0.6:

		- target specific alarm list may replace default alarm list
		  instead of being appended. Use "alarms override" directive
		  to do this.

* Version 0.6

	Main changes from 0.5:

		- apinger should properly kill child processes now

		- some (poor) documentation: FAQ

		- duplicate targets in combined reports removed

		- "forked receiver" disabled by default

		- proper use of pid_file and mailer configuration options

		- automatic check for loss measurements errors (caused by a bug
		  which I was not able to fix). Apinger will abort, when the
		  error is found! 

		- IPv6 support made optional (enabled by default)

		- better Message-Id and References headers in report messages


* Version 0.5

	Main changes from 0.4.1:
		- statistics gathering using RRDTool. May be used for making
		  graphs of packet loss and delays.
		  
		- much more precise delay measurement

* Version 0.4.1

	Main changes from 0.4:
		- some useless and nonportable debugging code removed. 
		  Fixes build on FreeBSD.

* Version 0.4

	Main changes from 0.3:

		- bugfixes
		- ability to merge reports of multiple alarms fired in some
		  configured interval ('combine' configuration directive)
		- possible memory-leaks removed
		- ability to repeat reports while alarm is on

* Version 0.3

	Main changes from 0.2:

		- file with status of targets may be written
		- configurable mail subject
		- external commands may be executed when alarm if fired/canceled
		- mailer (with custom options) may be configured
		- Message-Id and References headers are generated for mail messages
		  so "ALARM" and "alarm-canceled" messages may be paired together
		  by threading MUA

* Version 0.2

	Main changes from 0.1:
		
		- portability fixes (it compiles on FreeBSD now).
		- fixed bug with "down" alarms being fired on startup
		- sysconfdir set by configure script is used instead hardcoded 
		  /etc directory for config file
