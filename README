Alarm Pinger v. 0.1
===================

Alarm Pinger (apinger) is a little tool which monitors various IP devices by
simple ICMP echo requests. There are various other tools, that can do this,
but most of them are shell or perl scripts, spawning many processes, thus much
CPU-expensive, especially when one wants continuous monitoring and fast
response on target failure.  Alarm Pinger is a single process written in C, so
it doesn't need much CPU power even when monitoring many targets with frequent
probes.  Alarm Pinger supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The code has been tested on
Linux only, probably needs some porting to work on other platforms.

Alarm Pinger is quite configurable via /etc/apinger.conf file. The configuration file
contains definitions for alarms, targets and various parameters. See the apinger.conf
in the src/ directory for description.

apinger needs root privileges to start (to create raw sockets), but will drop
them before sending or receiving any packets.
