	<question><para>
		How can I graph <command>apinger</command> measurements?
	</para></question>
	<answer>
	<para>You will need <command>rrdtool</command> installed on
	the system, where <command>apinger</command> is running. Make
	sure <command>apinger</command> will find it. You may pass the
	path to the <command>configure</command> script before
	<command>apinger</command> compilation. </para>
	<para>To make <command>apinger</command> actually store the
	measurements, you need to set <command>rrd interval</command> global
	configuration option to some time interval and <command>rrd
	file</command> target configuration option to path of the database which
	will be written by <command>apinger</command>. The database should be
	writable by user set with <command>user</command> option.</para>
	<para>To graph the stored measurements you can use
	<application>rrdcgi</application> script generated by
	<command>apinger</command> with <option>-g</option> option followed by
	path to a directory where the graphs will be stored. Usually you will
	also need to pass <option>-l</option> followed with location of those
	graphs as seen on the HTTP server.</para>
